# UberEatsHack
Promo code spammer written in python using selenium.
! **NOT JUST FOR UBER EATS, WORKS WITH MOST OTHER FOOD DELIVERY WEBSITES TOO.** !
Written by me (mrbndzs) with help from telegram group.
---------------------------------------------------

**I have received dms that the uber eats bot starts slowly, I will fix this eventually, however for now, allow the program a few minutes to run.**

**This slowness is due to inefficiency in the selenium package.**

Any other issues, contact **scabberlab#8376** on discord.

# About

**How does it work?**

When on your uber eats/ deliveroo/ grubhub / other food delivery app checkout page, run the program and select the target % off you want. 

It should detect automatically what site you are on, and spam promo codes in the format of that specific site, at a rate of >200 codes per second.

If it finds an unused promo code that gives you a % off the same as or higher than what you want, it is automatically applied so you can continue onto checkout and buy food for cheap!

Here are the hit rates for the apps I've tested (given that about 200 codes are tested per second):

- **UberEats** (1/43k) = roughly 3.5 mins 

- **Deliveroo** (1/60k) = roughly 5 mins

- **GrubHub** (1/205k) = roughly 17 mins

# Is this bannable?

As long as you aren't using a brand new account and have some orders on your account, you will be able to apply promo codes and order food successfully while avoiding a ban.

However, using this too often is obviously very suspicious. No one would have more than 10 promo codes for 80% off that were sent as personal compensation from uber eats orders they haven't even bought unless they're doing something not legit.

Also, given that this only works because uber eats does not track who uses the promo codes they give out to certain people, if they begin to do so, this would not work anymore, or at least the hit rate would go down as you are only able to use public codes.

You can also help contribute to this project by contacting me to be given access to the private repo containing the src. 

Currently, the source is not public as people have resold previous open source projects of mine which they have not helped in.

Even as a closed source project, it is likely that people will try to sell it anyway, which is why I have included a link to this github in the UI (Settings -> About)

If you find anyone reselling this exe, check for this included github link and contact me.
